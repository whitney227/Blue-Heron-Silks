            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            <p>Fiber artist, Cecilia Ridge, has caught the attention of designers,
                fine galleries, and boutiques all across the southeast.  She studied both biology and art at
                the University of Alabama where she fell in love with transferring her drawings to colorful
                fabrics and clay.  After working thoughtfully to craft her unique dyes and designs, 
                Cecilia launched her studio in 2000.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p>Creative freedom came early for this fiber designer, who remembers as a 
                child painting and drawing every wall in her family's home with whimsical variations of animals.  Her playful imagination and childhood spent in Kentucky have inspired her designs as well as her love of coastal Georgia and current residence, Savannah.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
            <p>Cecilia draws her imagination from rich ornamentation and colors of the
                surrounding landscape.  Her design process entails painting on white silk, velvet and other lush fabrics
                to create multiple layers of rich colors and variations of her whimsical characters.  Many of her patterns
                reflect Cecilia's love of nature and include dragonflies, bees, ferns, birds, racehorses, and leaves. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
            <p>The finished fabrics are made into scarves, pillows, ties, purses, and
                other functional pieces of art.  Cecilia's color collections change with the seasons and 
                no two pieces are exactly the same.  From beginning to end, each item is handcrafted,
                insuring a one of a kind quality.  To inquire about special products or custom orders 
                contact the artist.
